    "## **6.1 Introduction to scikit-learn**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we will learn how to use **scikit-learn** not only as a library of machine learning models,\n",
    "but mainly as a **framework** for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- data preparation and preprocessing,\n",
    "- building end-to-end pipelines,\n",
    "- reproducible and correct model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We intentionally avoid complex models.\n",
    "Our goal is to understand the **scikit-learn workflow**, not to achieve state-of-the-art performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  *What is scikit-learn?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn is built on the concept of **estimators** — objects that follow a simple and unified API:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `fit(X, y)` — learn from the data\n",
    "- `predict(X)` — make predictions\n",
    "- `transform(X)` — transform the data (for preprocessing)\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything in scikit-learn that learns from data is an **estimator**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving deeper, here is the simplest possible sklearn model:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n",
    "\n",
    "model = LinearRegression()\n",
    "model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "preds = model.predict(X_test)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Estimators vs Transformers*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Estimator**: any object that implements `fit()`.\n",
    "  It can **learn from data**.\n",
    "  Examples: LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor, StandardScaler.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transformer**: a special type of estimator that also implements `transform()`.\n",
    "  It can **modify data** (e.g., scale, encode, impute).\n",
    "  Examples: StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder, SimpleImputer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model vs Transformer**:\n",
    "  - Model: usually `fit` + `predict`\n",
    "  - Transformer: usually `fit` + `transform` (or `fit_transform`)\n",
    "  - Pipelines can combine both into a single workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In short: *Every transformer is an estimator, but not every estimator is a transformer.*\n",

    "Use a `ColumnTransformer` with three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. StandardScaler → PolynomialFeatures for (`MedInc`, `Population`)\n",
    "2. MinMaxScaler → PolynomialFeatures for (`Latitude`, `Longitude`)\n",
    "3. OneHotEncoder for (`HouseAge_cat`)\n",

    "## 5. Models to train\n",
    "Train the following three models on the **same preprocessing pipeline**:\n",

    "3. `DecisionTreeRegressor` (with default parameters)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each model, create a full pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Pipeline([\n",
    "    (\"preprocess\", preprocessor),\n",
    "    (\"regressor\", ...)\n",
    "])\n",
    "```\n",
    "Fit all three models on the training set.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 6. Evaluation\n",
    "For each model, compute the **RMSE on the test set**:\n",
